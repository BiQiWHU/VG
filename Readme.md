Readme
In this project, we use VGG-VD-16 and GoogLeNet to implement very high resolution remote sensing image scene classification. The dataset is UC Merced dataset so that in the fully connected layer and softmax classifier, the number of parameter is set to be 21.
The process is listed as follows.
Step1. copy UC Merced dataset into the file folder and extract it.
Step2. run tfdata.py to generate training data and test data (The format is tfrecord).
Step3. run VG.py to train the model. Note that you can adjust the hyper-parameters according to your own dataset.
Step4. run test.py to test the model on the test data.
